# Endocrine System: Discovery mDNS

This is just a helper module for the [Endocrine System Core](https://github.com/jue89/endocrine-system-core) and [Endocrine System Edge](https://github.com/jue89/endocrine-system-edge). This module can be used to enable mDNS-based discovery. Once it has been connected for Core and Edge, they are able to connect to each other without any hardcoded FQDNs.
